# Analysis Roadmap:

1. [General statistics](general-statistics.html): Overview of the data, survival analysis, and descriptive analysis of exposures.
2. [Transmission modeling](transmission-risk-sensitivity.html): Code that fits transmission models using the survival likelihood optimization and sensitivity analysis. 
3. [Transmission model analysis](transmission-risk.html): Results from the final transmission model: weekly risk estimation by exposure source and dose-response curves.

# Data and other code

- Data and data processing code accessible through the "Data & Figures" tab above.
- Functions used throughout the analysis are [described and displayed here](project-functions.html).
